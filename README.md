#Git Global Graph
Git Global Graph is a layer on top of Git that creates a "Global Graph": a git commit graph that contains of the work being done in every local clone of a repository. It also provides a system to make queries on this shared information.

The initial implementation of Git Global Graph is used to track and reject commits that modify binary files in parallel.

## Status
The project is currently suitable for small usage and limited production. It is currently in testing for larger workflows.
