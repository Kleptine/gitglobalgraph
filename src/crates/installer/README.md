An installer for the Global Graph client. This client is installed into any client repository that wants to participate in the Global Graph. The installer can also optionally install a client pre-commit hook that checks the Global Graph for conflicts before committing.

Cross compilation not currently supported.

TODO:
 - Support uninstalling from a repository.
 - Support removing conflicts detection without removing Global Graph.
